# Bank-Simulation
This program implements an  event-driven simulation of a bank customer service. In this simulation, a priority queue was used  to maintain/organize the arrival and departure events of the customers, and a regular FIFO queue  was used to maintain the bank waiting line. Based on provided input data, this program prints the  simulation statistics and results to an output file.
